This Inventory Application is a project I completed as part of The Odin Project Curriculum to enhance my skills in Express.js, Node.js, SQL/PostGreSQL, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. In this project, I utilized concepts such as relational databases (items and categories), data management (add, edit delete), routes, controllers, and views. I also integrated Bootstrap accordions into my page, which was a new styling resource that I hadn't had much experience with previously. 

Overall, this was one of the more complex projects that I've completed. There were many moving parts that required a lot of trial and error, refactoring, and integrations to make sure the application ran smoothly while also keeping the code as clean as possible. Although this was challenging, it was a fun project that felt applicable to use cases I may come across in a development career.
